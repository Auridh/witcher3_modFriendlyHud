Use en.csv to localize the mod to your native language.

You can publish the localization on Nexus and link it to the mod using Nexus options.

If you don't know how or don't want to compile and distribute localized strings yourself,
you can send the localized file to me: wghost81@gmail.com.

If you want to encode localization file yourself, you will need W3 strings encoder.
id-space for the mod is 365.

Encoding example:
w3strings.exe --encode en.csv --id-space 365
